## Rerun is a visualization toolbox for real-world AI
Rerun lets you log images, point clouds, and other rich data as easily as you log text. View data live or record it for
later analysis. Utilize data-specific views to get a deeper understanding of your algorithms and application. Explore the entire lifetime of your application by navigating through time.

TODO(jleibs): Splash image

Rerun is made up of two main components:
 * The [Rerun Library](reference/library) lets you log data from [python](getting-started/python) or [rust](getting-started/rust)
 * The [Rerun Viewer](reference/viewer) lets you view data live or from a recording.

## Using Rerun
If this is your first time using Rerun, please check out the [Getting Started](getting-started) guide.

Otherwise, please check out the [How To Guides](how-to-guides) for solutions to common issues.

And if you just need an API reference, please consult the language-specific documentation for the Rerun library.
