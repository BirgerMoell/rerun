## Overview

Rerun provides a fast and extensible data visualization infrastructure for all kinds of data: 2D, 3D, timeseries, and any permutation thereof.

It is designed to be fast, flexible, extensible, and easily integrated anywhere.

The Rerun Viewer can be compiled to Wasm, allowing it to [run in a browser](https://demo.rerun.io/version/0.8.1) and be embedded anywhere you can put a web-view [(e.g. in Jupyter Notebook)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R9I7s4o6wydQC_zkybqaSRFTtlEaked_).

Use one of out logging SDKs to produce log data that is then either live-streamed to the Rerun Viewer, or stored in a file for later viewing.

Rerun is open-source, being built in the open on GitHub.

## Architecture Overview

*Message: we address each of our solutionâ€™s building bocks in a thorough manner, laying ground infrastructure for any future needs.*

**SDK:** you can log using C++, Python and Rust. The bulk of our SDKs are code-generated from a simple [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_(programming_language)), making it easy to extend in the future. The SDK produces [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/overview/) data.

The **Communication Layer** abstract the transport layers and enables the Rerun Viewer to ingest data from various sources, including files, TCP, and WebSocket.

The **Data Layer** provides a queryable store for arbitrary structured time-dependant data.

The **Vizualisation Layer** is made of composable, extensible collection building blocks covering 2D and 3D renderers, plotting widgets, and textual data display. We have written our own high-level renderer (link: re_rendered) on top of wgpu [LINK: wgpu anchor below]

**GUI:** We use [egui](https://www.egui.rs/) (made by our CTO), an easy-to-use [immediate mode GUI](https://github.com/emilk/egui#why-immediate-mode).

**3D Rendering:** We have written our own high-level renderer `[re_renderer](notion://www.notion.so/rerunio/crates/re_renderer/README.md)` on top of `wgpu`.

Data can be logged using C++, Python and Rust. The bulk of our SDKs are code-generated from a simple [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_(programming_language)), making it easy to extend in the future. The SDK produces [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/overview/) data.

Users can extend the builtin datatypes by logging arbitrary Arrow data.

Data is then stored and queried from a custom datastore built specifically to match our data model (timeseries of arbitrarily complex Arrow data).

Internally, the data model is implemented as a special purpose entity-component-system where time is a first-class citizen.

The Rerun viewer handles all visualization tasks. It is built atop egui (made by our CTO), an easy-to-use immediate mode GUI as well as `re_renderer`, a purpose-built 2D & 3D renderer built on top of `wgpu`.

Users can extend the Viewer with arbitrary visualizations of their own making.

## Extensibility

## Technology stack

*Message: show future-proofness by showing strong foundations and strong reasons to use them.*

### [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/overview/)
Arrow is a language-independent columnar memory format for arbitrary data. We use it to encode the log data on-the-wire and in our data store.

### Rust
The only mainstream language that is both fast and safe. https://www.rerun.io/blog/why-rust

### Wasm
We use [Wasm](https://webassembly.org) to get the viewer running at high speeds inside a browser or anywhere you can embed a web-view. For the native viewer we compile natively (no need for Electron!)

### `egui``
[egui](https://www.egui.rs) is an easy-to-use cross-platform, [immediate mode GUI](https://github.com/emilk/egui#why-immediate-mode) created by our CTO.

### `wgpu``
[wgpu](https://wgpu.rs) provides a high-performance abstraction over Vulkan, Metal, D3D12, D3D11, OpenGLES, WebGL and [WebGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGPU). This lets us write the same code graphics code for native as for web.

We use the WebGL backend when compiling for web. Once WebGPU is available in most browsers, we can easily switch to it for a nice performance boost!

We have written our own high-level rendering crate on top of `wgpu`, called [`re_renderer`](crates/re_renderer/README.md).


## Immediate mode
The Rerun Viewer uses an [immediate mode GUI](https://github.com/emilk/egui#why-immediate-mode), [`egui`](https://www.egui.rs/). This means that each frame the entire GUI is being laid out from scratch.

In fact, the whole of the Rerun Viewer is written in an immediate mode style. Each rendered frame it will query the in-RAM data store, massage the results, and feed it to the renderer.

The advantage of immediate mode is that is removes all state management. There is no callbacks that are called when some state has already changed, and the state of the blueprint is always in sync with what you see on screen.

Immediate mode is also a forcing function, forcing us to relentlessly optimize our code.
This leads to a very responsive GUI, where there is no "hickups" when switching data source or doing time scrubbing.

Of course, this will only take us so far. In the future we plan on caching queries and work submitted to the renderer so that we don't perform unnecessary work each frame. We also plan on doing larger operation in background threads. This will be necessary in order to support viewing large datasets, e.g. several million points. The plan is still to do so within an immediate mode framework, retaining most of the advantages of stateless code.
